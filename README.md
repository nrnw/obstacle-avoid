#Monocular vision based obstacle avoidance for mobile robots

This code includes a practical implementation of conceptual methods for obstacle avoidance, based on monocular vision with off-board processing and teleoperated control.

The performance tested remotely with very less latency. The implemented method uses a lightweight protocol to send commands to the mobile robot over a local or public network for manual control. The video feed can be transferred to the remote user with a considerable less latency. There is very minimal hardware present in the robot. However, since the computation happens inside a remote computer, it brings the advantage of adding more processing power to the application at a low cost.
